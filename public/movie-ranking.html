<hr />
<h3>DDLJ(Dil Waly Dulhaniya Lay Jaingy)</h3>
<p>This is a romance based movie about a desi girl named simran who falls in love with a guy named Raj,on her trip to Europe. They both go through immense difficulties in order to convince their desi parents for their marriage but in the end their love proves to be stronger than their familie`s old tradition of arrange marriages. </p>
<h3>Furious 7</h3>
<p>Furious 7 (also known as Fast & Furious 7) is an action film. This movie has an emotional aspect to it which preserves the memory of late paul walker (Brian O`Conner) who passed away in a traggic car accident during a holiday break from the filming process .</p>
<h3>Avengers: End Game</h3>
<p>It is my favourite marvel movie in which Tony Stark (Iron man) sacrifices himself to put an end to Thanos once and for all and brings back the people who got erased from the world. </p>
